The Koji for Developers documentation site is built and maintained by developers just like you.
You too can help by contributing to the site *structure*, writing new *articles*, or *suggesting edits* to existing documentation.

Anyone can open an issue about documentation, or contribute a change with a pull request to the `madewithkoji/docs` https://github.com/madewithkoji/docs[GitHub repository].

== Editing the documentation

The documentation is written in https://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] which is a lightweight markup language for simplifying the creation of documentation.
All the AsciiDoc files that map to this site can be found in the repository under `src/asciidoc/`.

Here's a quick example:

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Koji for Developers
Create your own templates for https://withkoji.com[Koji].


== Use any framework

* React
* Vanilla JS

[source,javascript]
console.log('Hello World');
----


To see more and get a better understanding of the syntax visit the https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc cheatsheet] and the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference].

=== Special syntax
There are a few extra bits of syntax added in to make the developer site ever better so make note of these as they aren't documented anywhere else.

==== Page Attributes
Page attributes are used to add extra data related to a document.
Add these to the top of your document, just under the document title.

Page slug::
	This corresponds to the page url and is used for linking between different pages.
	Syntax: `:page-slug: example-page`
Page description::
	This is a short description of the content of the page and is used when sharing the link on social media and chat platforms
	Syntax: `:page-description: This page is an example`
Page banner::
	This references an image which is used as the thumbnail when sharing the link on social media and chat platforms.
	Syntax: `:page-banner: \{imagesDir\}/example-page.png`

NOTE: `\{imagesDir\}` refers to the image directory, which can be found in the repository at `static/images`

TIP: If you have block images on your page you don't need to set the page banner, the first image will be used instead

==== Tabs
Sometimes it can be useful to sort your content into tabs.
You'll see them used particularly often to display code snippets for differing frameworks.
To add tabs into your document use the following syntax:

[source, asciidoc]
----
[.tabs]
--

.Tab 1 title
Tab 1 content.

.Tab 2 title
Tab 2 content.

--
----

And that will render link so:

[.tabs]
--

.Tab 1 title
Tab 1 content.

.Tab 2 title
Tab 2 content.

== Submitting your contribution

The source code for this site is available on https://github.com/madewithkoji/docs[GitHub].
To make a contribution you will need to make a pull request to the repository. To do so you will need to complete the following steps:

. https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo[Create a fork of the repository.]
. Make your changes.
. https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork[Create a pull request.]

=== Pull request checks

Once you have created your pull request it will need to go through some checks before it's added to the Koji for Developers site.

==== Build test

First off a Travis CI will run a test build to ensure there are no errors.
This step is automatic and will run shortly after you've created your pull request.
After a few minutes, if nothing went wrong, you should see a green checkmark against the second item in the branch action section of you pull request.

image::pull-request-passed-build.png[GitHub all checks have passed]

However, if the build didn't pass you will need to troubleshoot what went wrong.
You can run the same build process on your local branch by running:

[source,bash]
----
gatsby build
----

Once you've resolved the issue, push your new commits to the same branch and the pull request will re-run the build test.

==== Manual Review
After the build test has passed someone from the Koji team will need to review your pull request before it can be merged.
