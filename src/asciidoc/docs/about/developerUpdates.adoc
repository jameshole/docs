== 2020

=== October 12

* Dynamic receipts are now available for handling fulfillment of <<withkoji-koji-iap-package#, in-app purchases>>.
Dynamic receipts enable you to display a route in a Koji from a transaction receipt.
For example, you can show a video response from a seller to a buyer.
The following enhancements support implementation of dynamic receipts in Koji templates:
** The `dynamicReceipt` entitlement enables the receipt for a product to display routes in the Koji.
** When a buyer or seller views the transaction receipt for an applicable product, the platform appends the `dynamic-receipt` query parameter to the URL.
For example, `dynamic-receipt=buyer` or `dynamic-receipt=seller`.
** The `resolveReceiptById` method retrieves a specific transaction receipt.
* Reference docs for the <<withkoji-vcc-package#,VCC package>> have been updated.
* Step-by-step instructions for <<start-guide-2,extending your first template>> are now available in four “flavors” – React, Vanilla JS, Angular, and Svelte.
* Several pages were updated based on your feedback, including <<vcc-overview#>> and <<magazine-cover-blueprint#, Magazine cover blueprint>>.
