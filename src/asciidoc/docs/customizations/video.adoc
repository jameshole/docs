upload video files.
//end::description[]
* Uploaded videos are automatically compressed, transcoded to .mp4 format, and cropped to fit 16:9 portrait for optimal playback across devices.
* Pose detection data can be generated by passing an optional `typeOption`.
When specified, pose data is available after upload by appending `.poses` to the returned URL.
For example, `\https://objects.koji-cdn.com/project-id/my-video.mp4.poses`.
* A thumbnail for the uploaded video is available by appending `00001.png` to the returned URL.
