* Users can
//tag::description[]
upload video files.
//end::description[]
* Uploaded videos are automatically compressed, cropped, and transcoded to .mp4 format for optimal playback across devices.
Videos are cropped relative to the original aspect ratio, for a resulting aspect ratio of 16:9 (landscape) or 9:16 (portrait).
* Pose detection data can be generated by passing an optional `typeOption`.
When specified, pose data is available after upload by appending `.poses` to the returned URL.
For example, `\https://objects.koji-cdn.com/project-id/my-video.mp4.poses`.
* A thumbnail for the uploaded video is available by appending `00001.png` to the returned URL.
