Sounds can either be uploaded or obtained from a URL.
//end::description[]
* If the sound is loaded through the 'Upload' section, the sound can be cropped to only play a portion of it and the sound will be stored with the game.
* If the sound is loaded through the 'Advanced' section, it will use the sound that is at this URL, so keep in mind that if the link dies the sound will not play.
* Remember to keep sounds to a small length, this is part of projects that usually take up the most space and cause the longest load times.
