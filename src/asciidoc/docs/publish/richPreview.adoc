= Supporting rich previews
:page-slug: rich-preview-image

When users share a remix of your template on social media, Koji renders a rich preview (Open Graph) image based on a screenshot of the template.
By default, Koji takes a screenshot of the initial view when the template is loaded.

In some cases, the initial view might not be the best preview image for your template.
For example, if a game template starts with an instruction screen, a screenshot of the first level might provide a better preview image.
To improve the sharing experience in these cases, you can render a custom view of your template that is designed specifically to make an impression when sharing a remix.

== Customizing the sharing image

To customize the sharing image for your template, render a custom view when the URL contains the `koji-screenshot=1` query parameter.
For optimal rich preview support, design this view with the following considerations in mind.

* Responsiveness.
* Looks good with a square aspect ratio.
* Includes customizable elements to generate unique previews of each remix.

For the following example, assume the application supports remixes of the title, font size, and logo.

. In your main application code, add a conditional statement to the `render` function that displays a different image for social shares.

. Define appropriate styles for the rich preview image.

To ensure that it is displayed correctly, design the rich preview image as a responsive square.
