:page-description: Enable in-app purchases from your Koji templates.

The @withkoji/koji-iap package enables you to
//tag::description[]
implement in-app purchases from your Koji templates.
//end::description[]
For example, require a purchase to unlock a premium asset or a game.
This package provides frontend methods, for managing transactions with users, and backend methods, for validating purchases against receipts.

To implement a basic purchase flow in your template, use `getToken` on the frontend to obtain the current user's token. Then, use the callback function to route a request to the backend.
On the backend, use `resolveReceipts` to determine whether the user has purchased the product and return appropriate information to the frontend.
Finally, on the frontend, display the appropriate experience based on whether or not the product has been purchased.
For example, display a premium image that has been purchased.
Or, if the user hasn't purchased the image, display a *Purchase* button and use `startPurchase` to initiate a transaction when the user clicks the button.

== Install

Install the package in the frontend and backend services of your Koji project.

IMPORTANT: To support instant remixes of your template, you must also install the <<withkoji-vcc-package#>> package and implement the `VccMiddleware` on your backend server.
This middleware maintains the process variables for instant remixes, ensuring that purchases are applied to the correct remix version.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save @withkoji/iap
----

== Iap

To enable in-app purchases for your Koji template, you must implement the `Iap` class and define the `InAppPurchases` object in the `.koji/project/entitlements.json` file.

.Entitlements
[source,json]
----
{
  "entitlements": {
    "InAppPurchases": {
      "enabled": true,
      "products": [
        0 : {
          "sku": "productID", <1>
          "name": "{{scope.nameKey}}", <2>
          "price": "{{scope.priceKey}}", <3>
          "quantity": "{{scope.quantity}}",<4>
          "fulfillment": "email", <5>
          "isConsumable": true <6>
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Identifier for the product to purchase.
<2> Description displayed when a user is prompted to purchase the product.
Can be a string or a path to the <<vcc-overview#,Visual Customization Control (VCC)>> that defines the description.
<3> Path to the VCC that defines the purchase price, if applicable.
Alternatively, use `"priceIsUnset": true` to define a product without a set price.
For example, a donation or "pay what you want" price.
<4> (Optional) Maximum number of times the product can be sold.
After the inventory threshold is reached, further purchase attempts will display a “sold out!” message.
If quantity is not present or is 0, the product will never sell out.
<5> User information to collect for order fulfillment.
Possible values are `email`, `phone`, or `address`.
This information can be accessed on the transaction receipt.
<6> (Optional) Whether the product can be purchased more than once.

[.hcode, id="new Iap", reftext="new Iap"]
=== new Iap(projectID, projectToken)

Instantiates `Iap`.

==== Parameters

* `projectID` – (Backend only) _String_, unique identifier for the Koji.
* `projectToken` – (Backend only) _String_, secret key for the Koji.

TIP: When instantiating `Iap` on the backend, you must provide these parameters, which are available as environment variables at runtime.
For instant remixes, you must implement `VccMiddleware` to manage these variables.
See <<withkoji-vcc-package#>>.

==== Example

[source,javascript]
----
import Iap from '@withkoji/iap';

// Frontend
const iap = new Iap();

// Backend
const iap = new Iap(
  process.env.KOJI_PROJECT_ID,
  process.env.KOJI_PROJECT_TOKEN,
);
----

== Iap methods

[.hcode, id=".getToken", reftext="getToken"]
=== .getToken(handler, forceRefresh)

Gets a token identifying the current user, and invokes a callback function to handle backend requests for the user's purchases.

==== Parameters

* `handler` – _Function_, handles backend requests for the user's purchases.
Receives the following property as input:
** `userToken` – _String_, temporary token for the current user's session.
+
NOTE: A user token is created when a logged-in user loads a Koji, and destroyed when the user closes the Koji.
If the user revisits the Koji, a different token is generated.
Tokens are specific to a user and a Koji, so the same user will have different tokens for different Kojis.
To resolve purchases for a given user, both the user token, obtained on the frontend, and the project token, obtained from environment variables on the backend, are necessary.

* `forceRefresh` – (Optional) _Boolean_, indicates whether to generate a new user token before invoking the callback function (`false` by default).

==== Example

[source,javascript]
----
iap.getToken((token) => {
  // Request user's purchases and update template based on what has or has not been purchased
});
----

[.hcode, id=".loadProduct", reftext="loadProduct"]
=== .loadProduct(sku)

Gets the properties for a specified product.
Products are defined in the <<#_iap,entitlements file>> and registered or updated when the template is published.

==== Parameters

* `sku` – _String_, identifier for the product.

==== Returns

(Async) _Object_, properties defined in the entitlements file for the specified product.

==== Example

[source,javascript]
----
const product = await iap.loadProduct(sku);
----

[.hcode, id=".resolveReceipts", reftext="resolveReceipts"]
=== .resolveReceipts(userToken)

Retrieves the user's receipts, which can be used to validate purchases for specific products.

==== Parameters

* `userToken` – _String_, temporary token for the current user's session.
See <<.getToken>>.

==== Returns

(Async) Array of <<_iapreceipt>> objects, the user's purchases.

==== Example

[source,javascript]
----
const receipts = await iap.resolveReceipts(token);
// Look for the SKU to determine whether the user has purchased the product
hasPurchased = !!(receipts.find(({ product }) => product.sku === 'productID'));
----

[.hcode, id=".startPurchase", reftext="startPurchase"]
=== .startPurchase(sku, handler, purchaseOptions)

Prompts the user to purchase a product, and invokes a callback function to handle the results of the purchase.

==== Parameters

* `sku` – _String_, identifier for the product to purchase.
Products are defined in the <<#_iap,entitlements file>> and registered or updated when the template is published.
* `handler` – _Function_, handles the results of the purchase.
Receives the following properties as input:
** `success` – _Boolean_, indicates whether the purchase was successful.
** `userToken` – _String_, temporary token for the current user's session.
See <<.getToken>>.
* `purchaseOptions`– _Object_, custom information to add to the transaction receipt.

== Iap objects

=== IapReceipt

An `IapReceipt` object represents a receipt for a user's purchase of a product.
To determine whether a user has purchased a specific product, you can use use <<.resolveReceipts>> to retrieve the `IapReceipt` objects associated with the user's token, and then look for a receipt with the product's SKU.

The `IapReceipt` object includes the following properties.

TIP: Be sure to implement appropriate error handling to account for differences in object structure or empty values.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  id: string; <1>
  userId: string; <2>
  productId: string; <3>
  purchasedPrice: number; <4>
  attributes: { [index: string]: any }; <5>
  datePurchased: Date; <6>
  product: {
    id: string; <7>
    appId: string; <8>
    ownerUserId: string; <9>
    price: number; <10>
    priceIsUnset: boolean; <11>
    isConsumable: boolean; <12>
    name: string; <13>
    sku: string; <14>
    dateCreated: string; <15>

  };
}
----
<1> Unique identifier for the receipt.
<2> Koji user name of the user who purchased the product.
The `userId` return value will always be `unavailable`.
